# Personal AI Chatbot

Currently work in progress on personal AI chatbot that converses with users on behalf of myself. Limited topics of conversation available and can pick up common word pattern recognition with the implementation of the Natural Learning Toolkit (NLTK)
python library. My plan is to integrate deep learning models such as recurrent neural networks (RNN) to build onto the current NLTK response technique used by the bot. This will support the chatbot in focussing on the intent/context behind text rather
than simply a recognizable word.
